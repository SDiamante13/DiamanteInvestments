# DiamanteInvestments
To preview the application I have included an executable .jar file called DiamanteInvestments that you may download and run. 
Any files created by myself was done using Eclipse Oxygen and the Java programming language. New users may create new profiles and begin adding stocks to their portfolios. Note: you must know the stock symbol of the company you are searching for (i.e. TSLA, NFLX, AAPL). The candle stick chart can be viewed in an external window and supports several different timeframes that are controlled using radio buttons. There have been issues with AlphaVantage in getting some of the intraday timeframes so at this time if a plot is unavailable for a specific interval it will be blank.
